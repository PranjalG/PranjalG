👋 Hi, I’m @PranjalG

💡 Turning bugs into features since... well, since I wrote my first Hello World.
🚀 I build tech that solves real-life problems — like apps that remind you to blink.
📱 Currently juggling pixels (Flutter), divs (HTML), and caffeine levels.
🎨 Designs? I do that too — find my UI playground on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/PranjalG)
🧠 Thoughts & rants? Check out my blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gaurpranjal236)
